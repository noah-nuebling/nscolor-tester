Quickly test how different system NSColors look.

Investigation: NSColors that match SwiftUI GroupBox
  Result: There are no catalogue colors inside NSColor.h which match the fill and borderColor of a SwiftUI group box as of macOS Tahoe Beta 3 [Jul 10 2025]
  Plans:
    - File Feedback with Apple
    - Investigate private catalogue colors.
